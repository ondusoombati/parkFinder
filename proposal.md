# Proposal for ParkFinder Website

## Abstract
ParkFinder is an innovative web-based platform designed to help users discover parks in their location while allowing them to share their experiences through reviews and blogs. The system facilitates user authentication, park listing, and an interactive reviewing process. Administrators have additional functionalities for content moderation, contact management, and newsletter distribution. Built using Golang, ParkFinder provides an efficient, scalable, and secure solution with server-side rendering for optimal performance. This proposal outlines the project’s objectives, literature review, features, technical specifications, and development roadmap.

## Introduction
Parks play a significant role in urban planning, offering recreational spaces for communities. However, finding a suitable park with the desired amenities can be challenging. ParkFinder aims to bridge this gap by providing a digital solution where users can locate parks, read reviews, and contribute their experiences.

## Literature Review
### Importance of Parks in Urban Spaces
Parks serve as vital community spaces for relaxation, fitness, and social interactions. According to research, urban parks contribute to improved mental health, reduced air pollution, and increased community engagement. However, limited information accessibility about park locations, facilities, and reviews often discourages people from visiting them.

### Digital Solutions in Outdoor Recreation
Several platforms provide location-based services, such as Google Maps and TripAdvisor, which offer reviews for general locations. However, a dedicated platform focusing specifically on parks and user-generated content is lacking. ParkFinder provides a specialized service where users can not only locate parks but also share detailed experiences and recommendations.

### Use of Golang in Web Applications
Golang is known for its high performance, concurrency, and efficient memory usage, making it suitable for web applications requiring fast data processing. By implementing Golang, ParkFinder ensures seamless database transactions, template rendering, and API integration while maintaining a lightweight server-side architecture.

## Objectives
1. To develop a digital platform for users to find parks based on their location.
2. To provide a platform for users to create accounts and share their park experiences through blogs and reviews.
3. To implement an administrative panel for managing user content, newsletters, and user interactions.
4. To ensure seamless user authentication, content moderation, and secure data management.
5. To optimize the platform for scalability, security, and high-performance rendering.
